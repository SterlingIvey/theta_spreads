# theta_spreads

# I built this tool to visualize and automate calculations for selling iron condors and credit spreads. Through scraping, it pulls the yesterday's (or today's if after 4:00 PM EST) price of SPX and XSP. It also pulls current price of the VIX. This is expressed in 'Implied Volatility' on the dashboard.
